Welcome to the new Plum Run HOA website.

This site is intended to provide information for lot owners and residents
of the Plum Run neighborhood located in Sellersburg, IN.

Included on the site are the following:

1. A brief introductory about the neighborhood and its history.
2. A current list of Board Members.
3. A list of documents available such as the Covenants and Restrictions.
4. A link to the neighborhood's social media site.
5. A list of import web links for local government and utilities.
6. A contact form.

The menu button and the contact form include JavaScript. The site is nowhere
near where I intended it to be when I began and is in fact my 2nd version.
The main page text content will be minimal as the majority of action will eventually
be driven from the documents page and the contact form. As a result, no CSS has been
coded for the content in each of the pages until I am able to discern exactly what
the board is looking for.

NOTE: I could not figure out how to get the menu button to display in the mobile
view. I worked with Joey some, but was not able to get his suggestions to work. :(
But I really appreciated his help!
