Welcome to the new Plum Run HOA website.

This site is intended to provide information for lot owners and residents
of the Plum Run neighborhood located in Sellersburg, IN.

Included on the site are the following:

1. A brief introductory about the neighborhood and its history.
2. A current list of Board Members.
3. A list of documents available such as the Covenants and Restrictions.
4. A link to the neighborhood's social media site.
5. A list of import web links for local government and utilities.
6. A contact form.

The menu button and the contact form include JavaScript. The site is nowhere
near where I intended it to be when I began and is in fact my 2nd version.
